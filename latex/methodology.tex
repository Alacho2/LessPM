In today's world of rapidly evolving technology, it is crucial to have a
solid foundation in the underlying concepts and protocols that drive modern
systems.
This section aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the key
technologies and principles that are relevant to LessPM\@.
As we explore the development and implementation of LessPM, our focus will be
on the key components, technologies, principles, and steps that form LessPM's
development process an encapsulation.

Our approach encompasses an explanation of the system architecture, as well as
an in-depth description of the key components, technologies, tools, and steps
that are involved in LessPM's encapsulation and development process to create
the prototype.
By thoroughly exploring these fundamental topics, we can better appreciate their
significance and application in the context of the implementation, design, and
architecture presented in LessPM\@.

One critical aspect of the development and system is its security and
robustness.
By providing a comprehensive account of the system development process, we aim
to enable readers to understand the technical aspects of our work and assess the
validity and relevance of our findings.
