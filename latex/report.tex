    Purpose:
    Executive Summary: The primary goal of an executive summary is to present a condensed version of the report's main
    findings, conclusions, and recommendations. It is targeted at decision-makers or executives who may not have the
    time to read the entire report. The executive summary aims to persuade the reader to take action based on the
    presented information.

    Content:
    Executive Summary: The executive summary typically includes background information, the problem or issue addressed,
    methodology, key findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
    It may also emphasize the report's significance or the implications of the findings.

    LEngth:
    Executive Summary: Executive summaries are usually longer than abstracts, ranging from a few paragraphs to a
    few pages, depending on the length and complexity of the report.
    The executive summary aims to provide enough detail to give a comprehensive understanding of the report's key
    points while still being concise.

    Abstract: The purpose of an abstract is to provide a brief, comprehensive overview of the report's content,
    including its objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
    It is primarily intended for researchers, academics, or other professionals who want to quickly assess whether the
    report is relevant to their interests before deciding to read the entire document.

    Abstract: An abstract usually contains a brief introduction to the topic, the research question or problem,
    the methodology used, a summary of the results, and the main conclusions drawn from the study.
    It does not typically include recommendations or opinions.

    Abstract: Abstracts are typically shorter than executive summaries, usually limited to a single paragraph or around
    150--300 words.
    The abstract provides a high-level overview of the report's content and is meant to be as concise as possible.

    \section*{Future work}\label{sec:futurework}
    Through implementing LessPM, we aimed to create a barebone implementation that could serve as a reliable Minimal
    Viable Product (MVP). However, we recognize that more work is needed to further enhance and compliment the product.
    The related topics to further improve LessPM are listed below and briefly discussed as a way to highlight
    potential drawbacks of the current version.
