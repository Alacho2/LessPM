Through implementing LessPM, we aimed to create a barebone implementation that could serve as a reliable Minimal
    Viable Product (MVP). However, we recognize that more work is needed to further enhance and compliment the product.
    The related topics to further improve LessPM are listed below and briefly discussed as a way to highlight
    potential drawbacks of the current version.

    \begin{enumerate}[label=$\blacktriangleright$]
        \item \textbf{Authorization Headers}
        \item \textbf{AES Key Encryption for Password}
        \item \textbf{Hardcoded AES for JWT}
        \item \textbf{Encrypted Passkey}
        \item \textbf{Attaching connecting IP to JWT}
        \iffalse
        \item \textbf{Credential ID} \newline In its current implementation, LessPM supports a single registered
        authenticator per username to maintain a focused security approach.
        During registration, the server checks the database for an existing username similar to the incoming one
        and aborts the registration ceremony if a match is found.
        While WebAuthn permits users to have multiple authenticators, limiting this feature in the initial iteration of
        LessPM helps ensure a more controlled security environment.
        As the system evolves, considering the addition of support for multiple authenticators can be weighed against
        potential security risks and benefits.
