We describe the implementation of LessPM, a passwordless password manager
using Rust as a programming language.
While traditional passwords have a long and respectable history, they have
become increasingly vulnerable to attacks such as brute-forcing, phishing, and
keylogging.
LessPM seeks to address these deficiencies with a sophisticated
authentication method, called WebAuthn.

Through asymmetric cryptography, WebAuthn provides a secure authentication
experience with the help of user-owned devices such as smartphones or hardware
authenticator devices.
This would eliminate the use of traditional passwords.
To secure passwords stored in LessPM's, we employ AES-256 for encryption and
Argon2 for hashing, WebAuthn's Credential ID serves as a key, combined with
randomly generated salts and pepper.

We also use Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) to secure
communication between client and server and configured Cross-Origin Request
Sharing (CORS).
Additionally, we used an encrypted version of JSON Web Tokens (JWT, RFC7519),
inspired by JSON Web Encryption (JWE, RFC7516), to maintain user authentication
between HTTPS requests.

We created a separate client as a visual proof-of-concept to adhere to a
principle of least-knowledge, while the server handles requests and securely
stores user data separately.
Finally, we include a security analysis in LessPM's context.

The report provides valuable insights into the implementation and potential
benefits of using WebAuthn and a passwordless approach, along with the security
measures employed to protect user data on the server, offering promising
prospects for a passwordless future in digital security.
