    Purpose:
    Executive Summary: The primary goal of an executive summary is to present a condensed version of the report's main
    findings, conclusions, and recommendations. It is targeted at decision-makers or executives who may not have the
    time to read the entire report. The executive summary aims to persuade the reader to take action based on the
    presented information.

    Content:
    Executive Summary: The executive summary typically includes background information, the problem or issue addressed,
    methodology, key findings, conclusions, and recommendations.
    It may also emphasize the report's significance or the implications of the findings.

    LEngth:
    Executive Summary: Executive summaries are usually longer than abstracts, ranging from a few paragraphs to a
    few pages, depending on the length and complexity of the report.
    The executive summary aims to provide enough detail to give a comprehensive understanding of the report's key
    points while still being concise.
