We describe the implementation of LessPM, a passwordless password manager that
utilizes WebAuthn's asymmetric cryptographic nature to attempt to create a more
secure authentication experience with the help of smartphones and other
user-owned devices.
Despite traditional passwords' long and respectable history, the limitations of
conventional password authentication have become increasingly apparent through
brute-force and phishing attacks, password reuse, keylogging, and shoulder
surfing.
This has led to the development of more sophisticated methods, such as WebAuthn.

To help secure the server where LessPM's passwords are, we use AES-256 and
Argon2 for encryption, combined with WebAuthn's Credential ID, randomly
generated salts, and pepper for key derivation.
Additionally, we secured the server using HTTPS, configured CORS, and utilized
an encrypted variation of JWT (RFC7519), inspired by JWE (RFC7516), to maintain
user authentication between requests from a client.

We created a separate client as a proof-of-concept to adhere to The Law of
Demeter, while the server handles requests and securely stores user data.
This approach offers promising prospects for a passwordless future in digital
security.

This report provides valuable insights into the implementation and potential
benefits of using WebAuthn and a passwordless approach, along with the security
measures used to protect user data on the server.
