JSON Web Token (JWT) was introduced as part of RFC 7519 in 2015~\cite{RFC7519}.
It is a compact URL-safe string intended to transfer data between two entities.
They can be used as part of an authentication and authorization scheme in a web
service, application, or API\@.
The data in the string is intended as a payload and is referenced as a
\texttt{claim}~\cite{RFC7519}.

A JWT typically consist of three parts: header, payload, and signature.
The header and payload are serialized into JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
and then encoded using a Base64Url encoding to ensure a URL-safe
format~\cite{RFC7519}.

The token contains an expiry timestamp, which, when decoded, is validated if
the timestamp is not passed at the time of decoding.
JWTs can be cryptographically signed using various algorithms like Hash-Based
Message Authentication (HMAC), Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), or
Elliptic-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) ensuring the integrity and
authenticity of the token~\cite{RFC7519}.
This prevents unknown authorities from constructing or hijacking existing
tokens.\footnote{
  Hijacking a token could happen by a man-in-the-middle attack.
  This is done by a third-party individual listening and intercepting traffic
  in order to either read data or input their own in a client's request.
  This would allow an attacker to gain access to privileged information.
}
The URL-safe format of a JWT is often performed through a Base64 string, which
permits larger bits of data to be sent in a compressed, safe\footnote{
  Safe in this context should not be interchanged with secure.
  We reference safe as a way to transfer the data over the selected protocol,
  in most cases HTTP(S).
} format~\cite{RFC7519}.
JWTs are widely used for scenarios like single sign-on (SSO), user
authentication, and securing API endpoints by providing an efficient, stateless
mechanism for transmitting information about the user's identity, permissions,
and other relevant data~\cite{karande2018securingnode}.
