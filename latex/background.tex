In today's world of rapidly evolving technology, it is essential to have a
strong foundation in the underlying concepts and protocols that drive modern
systems.
This background chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the key
technologies and principles that are relevant to our report.
By delving into these fundamental topics, we can better appreciate their
significance and application in the context of the implementation, design, and
architecture presented in the subsequent chapters.

% We explore literature related to hunduntuunuhunn

We will provide background information on topics such as WebAuthn
(Section~\ref{subsec:webauthn}), JSON Web Tokens (JWT\@.
Section~\ref{subsec:jsonwebtokens}), JSON Web Encryption (JWE\@.
Section~\ref{subsec:jsonwebtokens}), hashing through Argon2
(Section~\ref{subsec:hashing-through-argon2}), and Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES. Section~\ref{subsec:aes}).

% You should probably blabber some more here but we will do that when we have gotten further with the actual writing.
