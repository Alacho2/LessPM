We describe the implementation of LessPM, a passwordless password manager
using Rust as a programming language.
This passwordless password manager utilizes WebAuthn's asymmetric cryptographic
nature to provide a more secure authentication experience with the help of
user-owned devices such as smartphones.
While traditional passwords have a long and respectable history, they have
become increasingly vulnerable to attacks such as brute-forcing, phishing, and
keylogging.
LessPM seeks to address these limitations with WebAuthn's sophisticated
authentication methods.
To secure LessPM's passwords on the server, we employ AES-256 and Argon2 for
encryption, WebAuthn's Credential ID, randomly generated salts, and pepper for
key derivation.

We also use HTTPS to secure the server and configure CORS.
Additionally, we use an encrypted version of JWT (RFC7519), inspired by
JWE (RFC7516), to maintain user authentication between client requests.

We created a separate client as a visual
proof-of-concept to adhere to The Law of Demeter,while the server handles
requests and securely stores user data.
This approach offers promising prospects for a passwordless future in digital
security.

This report provides valuable insights into the implementation and potential
benefits of using WebAuthn and a passwordless approach, along with the security
measures employed to protect user data on the server.
