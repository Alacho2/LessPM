Polybius' \textit{The Histories}~\cite{perseus_tufts} contains the first documented use of passwords, describing how
the Romans employed ``\textit{watchwords}'' to verify identities within the military.
This provided a transparent, simple way to allow or deny entry to restricted areas of authorized personnel only.
The story of secret writing (in this context referenced as cryptography) goes back the past 3000 years~\cite{history_cryptography_cryptanalysis},
where the need to protect and preserve privacy between two or more individuals blossomed.

Fernando J. Corbat√≥ is widely credited as the all-father of the first computer password when he was responsible for
the Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) in 1961 at MIT~\cite{levy1984hackers}.
The system had a \texttt{"LOGIN"} command, which, when the user followed it by typing \texttt{"PASSWORD"},
had its printing mechanism turned off to offer the applicant privacy while typing the password~\cite{ctss_programmers_guide}.
Given the long history of passwords and their importance, one could argue that it was a natural and judicious
step in the evolution of computer systems.

In today's digital landscape, utilizing various identifiers (such as usernames, email addresses, or phone numbers)
combined with passwords has become a prevalent method for verifying an individual's identity and ensuring
their authorization to access restricted materials.

In 2004, a study titled \textit{"The Memorability and Security of Passwords"}~\cite{yan2000password} was conducted into
advising users on the entropy of passwords and ways someone can use to remember a or multiple passwords.
A typical standard for larger organizations with a form of password creation system is to emphasize the diversity of
smaller characters, capitalized characters, length, and not be commonly referred to in a dictionary~\cite{yan2000password}.
The study analyzed the effectiveness of different password-creation strategies, suggesting that acronym-based
passwords offer a delicate balance between memorability and security\cite{yan2000password}.

However, as technology has advanced, the limitations of password-based authentication have become increasingly
apparent, leading to the development of more sophisticated methods like Universal Authentication Framework
(UAF)~\cite{fido_uaf_overview} and WebAuthn\cite{webauthn_level_2} through the Fast IDentity Online Alliance
\href{https://fidoalliance.org}{(FIDO)} and The \href{https://www.w3.org}{World Wide Web Consortium} (W3C).

WebAuthn, short for Web Authentication, is an open standard for web-based authentication that enables users to
securely access online web services without relying on a traditional password.
Through a collaborative effort between FIDO and W3C, WebAuthn is developed to leverage asymmetric cryptography\footnote{
    Asymmetric cryptography uses a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. The public key encrypts
    data, while the private key decrypts it. The keys are mathematically related, but deriving one from the other 
    is infeasible, ensuring secure communication and data exchange.}\footnote{
    \textbf{Note:} According to the library used to implement
    \href{https://docs.rs/jsonwebtoken/latest/jsonwebtoken/index.html}{jsonwebtokens in Rust}
    it is the private key that encrypts and the public key is responsible for \href{https://docs.rs/jsonwebtoken/latest/jsonwebtoken/struct.DecodingKey.html#method.from_rsa_pem}
    {decrypting}. \textit{Last Accessed: 2023-03-25}.}
and biometric or hardware-based authenticators to provide a more secure and robust authentication experience.

This report delves into the implementation of LessPM, a passwordless password manager that leverages WebAuthn to provide a secure
authentication experience, free from the constraints of traditional passwords, while placing a strong emphasis on
security.
By examining recent advancements in authentication mechanisms and the related innovative potential of WebAuthn, we
hope to illuminate the prospects of a passwordless future in digital security.
